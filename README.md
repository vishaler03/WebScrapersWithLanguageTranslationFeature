# WebScrapersWithLanguageTranslationFeature
Scrapers for multiple websites, can scrap entire website and store the data in your own native language using google translation.
Use Jupyter or any ipynb file editor to edit/view the files.
These web scraping scripts are completely automated and requires ZERO (0) human interference to run.
These are strongly capable of extracting entire website's data and store it to your local machine after converting the texts to your desired language using google translation.
Hope they help!
Thanks!
